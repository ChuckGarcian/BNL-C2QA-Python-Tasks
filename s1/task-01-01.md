# Question 1
For the given sequence, we claim the definition of $f(n)$ is the following:
$$ f(n) = \frac{{2^{1+ n \% 2}} \cdot (-1)^{n-1}}{{n+ n \% 2}} $$

# Question 2
Using the definition of $f(n)$ from above, we have the summation as follows:
$$\sum_{1000}^{n=1} f(n) = ~ 6.792$$

# Question 3
Using the definition of $f(n)$ from above, we have $f(-2.7)$ as follows:

$$f(n) = -\frac{2.894+3.984 \cdot i }{1.400}$$

# Source Code 

```
from fractions import Fraction

## Question 1
# Implementation of f(n)
def f(n):
  parity = n % 2
  numerator = (2 ** (1 + parity)) * ((-1) ** (parity+1))
  denominator = n + parity 
  return (numerator, denominator)

# First print the sequence to check with the given sequence
for i in range (1, 13):
  val = f(i)
  num = val[0]
  denom = val[1]
  print (f"n: {i} â†’ f(n): {num} / {denom}")

## Question 2
sum = 0
# Now we compute the sum to 1000
for i in range (1, 1001):
  val = f(i)
  sum += val[0] / val[1]
print (f"Summation: {sum}")

## Question 3
print (f"f(-2.7): {f(-2.7)}")
```
